- Emphasize voice in PostScripts ("hear your grandmother's voice on your birthday")

### 3. Instant Family Sharing
"Story saved at 3pm? Your daughter in Seattle sees it at 3:01pm." YT V2 could:
- Implement real-time family feed
- Push notifications for new memories
- "Family activity" dashboard section

### 4. Data Sovereignty Messaging
HeritageWhisper explicitly addresses data ownership concerns. YT V2 should:
- Add clear data export features
- Message around privacy and control

### 6. Founder Story Connection
HeritageWhisper's about page creates emotional connection. YT V2 could:

### 2. Visual Organization
YT V2's media capabilities far exceed HeritageWhisper:
- 3D globe map view

HeritageWhisper = Capture the past
YoursTruly = **Bridge past to future**

### Marketing Angles Against HeritageWhisper
1. "What if you could send that story to your grandchildren on their 18th birthday?"
